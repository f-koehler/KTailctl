# KTailctl v0.19.0

This update prevents KTailctl from starting multiple instances and instead puts the existing one in the foreground. A new toggle in the settings allows to enable and disable LAN access while using an exit node.

## Features

- Display last used exit node in addition to suggested exit node for quick access
- Add toggle for LAN access while using an exit node

## Fixes

- Only start a single instance of KTailctl by registering a DBus service
- Open main window of already running instance when trying to start another one

## Chores

- Go dependencies
  - `golang.org/x/net`: `v0.32.0` -> `v0.34.0`
  - `tailscale.com`: `v1.78.1` -> `v1.78.3`
